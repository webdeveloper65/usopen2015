		<h1>Raonic Serves Up Milestone In US Open Win</h1>
			<p>Milos Raonic dominated on serve to dismiss American Tim Smyczek 6-4, 7-6(8), 6-1 in the first round of the US Open on Monday. The 10th seed earned his 200th tour-level win in two hours and 13 minutes by saving all six break points faced.
Both players took care of their service games in the early part of the match. Raonic broke Smyczek on the first break chance of the day at 4-4, then served out the first set a game later. The American, No. 99 in the Emirates ATP Rankings, stepped up his game in the second set, which was settled in a tie-break. Raonic found himself down set point, but extended the game with a miraculous stretch volley at 5/6 and secured a two-set lead minutes later.
“I think sometimes I wasn't stepping up and being aggressive enough,” said Raonic. “Sometimes I was making mental lapses. I wasn't as sharp as I wanted to be. It was more about knowing and being aware and not rushing. Sometimes I felt like I would just sort of go through things too quickly throughout many parts of the match. I wasn't always as disciplined with myself as I should have been.”
The escape bolstered Raonic’s confidence, and the Canadian raced to a 5-0 lead in the third set before closing out the match with four consecutive 140mph-plus first serves, including an unplayable 147mph blast on match point.
Awaiting Raonic in the second round is Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who saw off German veteran Tommy Haas 3-6, 6-1, 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-1. The 37-year-old Haas was the oldest player in the draw and was making a return to Flushing Meadows after missing the 2014 US Open due to injury.
The FedEx ATP Head2Head series between Raonic and Verdasco is deadlocked at 3-3, with Raonic the winner of their previous meeting (Shanghai 2013). The pair has never squared off at a Grand Slam.
“It will be a tough match,” said Raonic. “Every single time we've played it's been that way. I'm going to need to play better. But I have it within myself to find those answers and hopefully make the most of the opportunity.”
Defending US Open champion Marin Cilic moved through in straight sets against qualifier Guido Pella 6-3, 7-6(3), 7-6(3). The 25-year-old Argentinian double-faulted on match point and recorded his third loss in as many main draw matches in New York. Cilic only faced one break point during the two-hour match.
Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 in 94 minutes. Tsonga struck 16 aces and just one double fault in the win, and did not face a break point. In the second round, he will take on Marcel Granollers, a 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 winner against Lukas Lacko.</p>
