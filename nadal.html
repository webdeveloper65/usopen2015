			<h1>2015 US Open: Rafael Nadal loses final three sets, upset by Fabio Fognini</h1>
			<p>For the first time since 2005, Rafael Nadal failed to advance past the third round of the US Open. The No. 8 seeded Nadal was eliminated on Friday night, losing to No. 32 Fabio Fognini in five sets.  The loss was a surprising one for Nadal because of the success he's had the the U.S. Open. It's even more shocking because of how the match started. Early in the match, it looked like Nadal was going to head to the next round with ease. He won the first two sets 6-3, 6-4 and was just one set away from winning. A 2-0 lead for Nadal is a virtual lock of victory for Nadal, or at least it used to be. Prior to Friday night, Nadal was 151-0 when up two sets in a grand slam match, according to Adnan Virk of ESPN.  That streak came to a crashing end as Fognini stormed back 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 to take the match and stun Nadal. Fognini's comeback was complete when Nadal's return sailed wide and sealed the match and upset.</p>
