				<p>World No. 1 Novak Djokovic won his second US Open championship and his 10th career Grand Slam title with an electric four-set victory over 17-time major winner Roger Federer on Sunday evening.  Djokovic jumped out to a one-set lead against the uncharacteristically sloppy Federer, who struggled to find his rhythm on serve. The 34-year-old clawed his way back into the match in a 62-minute second set that saw him convert one of nine break points while never facing one on his own serve. </p>

				<p>With the loss, Federer fell to 21-21 against Djokovic in their FedEx ATP Head2Head rivalry. He will go another calendar year since winning Wimbledon in 2012 without a Grand Slam title, but the 34 year old was happy about making the US Open final for the first time since 2009 (l. to Del Potro) and putting together a solid showing against the top-ranked player in the world. A victory would have made Federer the first player in the Open Era to win six US Open titles and the oldest US Open champion since 35-year-old Ken Rosewall in 1970.</p>
