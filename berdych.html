		<h1>Tomas Berdych</h1>
		<p>Tomas Berdych was on the brink of falling behind two sets to none against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, but the Czech survived the Spaniard's test, prevailing 6-7(2), 7-6(7), 6-3, 6-3.
Berdych needed three hours and 22 minutes to book his spot in the Round of 16 for a fourth consecutive year, firing 53 total winners and converting on six of 14 break opportunities to defeat World No. 31 Garcia-Lopez. The Czech draws level in the FedEx ATP Head2Head against the Spaniard at 3-3, having dropped their most recent meeting at the 2014 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters.
"I felt good all the way through," said Berdych. "The first set wasn't the best. I had a set point and had my chances, but wasn't able to make it. He played quite well and unfortunately didn't happen to win the first set. Then, it was a close second set and I was on top of him and playing well. It was a matter of time to take my chances and that's what I did."
Berdych will renew his 10-year-old rivalry against Richard Gasquet with a quarter-final berth at stake. The series is tied at 6-6, with the Czech winning in straight sets this year in Doha and Madrid.
"Gasquet is a very tough opponent," added Berdych. "He's playing really well lately and having some good results."
The World No. 12 Frenchman downed Bernard Tomic 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 in just under an hour and a half, dominating in points under four shots (60-43). He hit 43 winners to Tomic's 23. Gasquet reached the fourth round at the US Open for the sixth time, having reached the semi-finals in 2013 (l. to Nadal).</p>
