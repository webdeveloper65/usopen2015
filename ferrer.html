		<h1>David Ferrer</h1>
			<p>It was a battle, but David Ferrer gets himself a solid straight set win over his young Serbian opponent. As is so often the case against Ferrer, the Serb's risky aggression just didn't cut it against a man who can retrieve so much.  Another dogfight of a set over on court 17, the type of set that David Ferrer loves more than all else. Perhaps the worst score in tennis is a 7-5 set in which the server crumbles one game before the tiebreak – a feat Krajinovic has now achieved twice.  After a bit of a tussle, Ferrer gets his favoured return into gear and brushes aside the increasing challenge of Krajinovic just before the irritating lottery of a tiebreak. A backhand return straight to Krajinovic's feet sealed the set, and he's looking pretty good now.  David Ferrer falls to Jeremy Chardy: No. 27 Jeremy Chardy upset No. 7 David Ferrer on Friday at Armstrong, pulling out a 7–6(6), 4–6, 6–3, 6–1 victory. Chardy hit 55 unforced errors, 20 more than Ferrer, but he also struck 28 winners, compared to just 11 from Ferrer. The loss means this year will be the first since 2011 that Ferrer didn’t make at least two Grand Slam quarterfinals. Ferrer’s defeat, coupled with earlier upsets to No. 4 Kei Nishikori, leaves No. 9 Marin Cilic as his quarter’s top remaining seed. Don’t look now, but Cilic—who has disappointed this year after his shocking 2014 U.S. Open title—has a fairly smooth path to the semifinals. Cilic will play Chardy in the fourth round.</p>
